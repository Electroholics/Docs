<h3>Brief Description:</h3> 
This TinkerEve is the first in the 3 part series by Electroholics Club where we will cover all the basics of Analog, We will use theory, simulation and hardware design to teach the concepts. In this session, we will intuitively analyse and simulate Low pass, high pass and band pass filters and other forms of RLC circuits. All the simulations will be done on <a href="http://158.132.149.224/scwong/download/download.html">Winspice</a> so install it beforehand. 

<h3>Topics to be covered:</h3>

  <li>Capacitor-Switch circuits.</li>
  <li>Boosting of voltage.</li>
  
<h3>Prerequisites:</h3> None.
