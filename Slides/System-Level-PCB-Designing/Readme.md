<h3>Description: </h3> 

This week we are going to have a detailed session on System level PCB designing

(using Eagle CAD). However, this time we are not going to restrict ourselves to a 

minimal PCB design rather we will cover everything from component selection 

till multi-layer industry standard design. 

Our target audience could be anyone from B.Tech, M.Tech or Ph.D. For ECE folks, 

this could be an additional skill, worth adding to your CVâ€™s

<h3>Prerequisites:</h3> Some extra bonding for hardware design. Please bring a laptop 

with a latest version of <a href="http://www.cadsoftusa.com/download-eagle/">Cadsoft Eagle (freeware)</a> and a high-resolution mouse.

<h3>Topic to be covered:</h3>

1. Block Level Design (Brief)

2. Component Selection (Brief)

3. Schematic Capture (Brief)

4. Labeling and Netting (Detailed)

5. Editing Eagle Libraries (Detailed)

6. Making New Eagle Libraries (Detailed)

7. Board Design (Detailed)

8. Multi-layer Routing (Detailed)

PS: Manoj will be taking this session. So, expect some detailed stuff.
