<h3>Brief Description:</h3> 
This TinkerEve is the First in the Three part series by Electroholics Club which will cover all the basics of Analog Circuit Design. We will use theory, simulation and hardware design to teach the concepts. In this session, we will intuitively analyse and simulate Low pass, high pass and band pass filters and other forms of RLC circuits. All the simulations will be done on <a href="http://158.132.149.224/scwong/download/download.html">Winspice</a> so install it beforehand. 

<h3>Topics to be covered:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>RC, RL, LC Circuits.</li>
  <li>RLC Circuits.</li>
  <li>Capacitor-Switch circuits.</li>
  <li>Boosting of voltage.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Prerequisites:</h3> None.
